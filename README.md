A small plugin with a goal to provide user-friendly way to navigate between functions and their references.<br/>
Additionally, it allows to import reports generated by i.e. [PE-sieve](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-sieve/wiki/1.-FAQ) into IDA. Supports:
+ [`.tag` format](https://github.com/hasherezade/tiny_tracer/wiki/Using-the-TAGs-with-disassemblers-and-debuggers) (generated by [PE-sieve](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-sieve), [Tiny Tracer](https://github.com/hasherezade/tiny_tracer), [PE-bear](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-bear-releases))
+ [`.imports.txt` format](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-sieve/wiki/4.3.-Import-table-reconstruction-(imp)) (generated by [PE-sieve](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-sieve))
